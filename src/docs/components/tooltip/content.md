Tooltips are used for user education on specific elements with clear layout bounds. All visibility state is managed internally in the `Tooltip` component; non-persistent tooltips are displayed when the user mouses over the children, and are hidden otherwise.

By default, the width of the tooltip matches that of the enclosed children. Explicitly specifying a width using the `width` prop is recommended if you need more precise control over the size of the tooltip.
