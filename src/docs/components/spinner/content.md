Usage of a `Spinner` is advised when there is no clearly defined container, and the indeterminate progress indicated by the `Spinner` is relevant only to a single component rather than a container of components. Usage of a `LoadingBar` is more appropriate when there is a clearly defined container and the progress is relevant to the entire container.
